# RUSH ROLL Game

## Overview
RUSH ROLL is a fun, luck-based multiplayer dice game where players aim to be the first to reach a score of 50 points. Players take turns rolling a die, accumulating points while trying to avoid rolling a "1" which resets their score.

## Features
- Supports 2 to 4 players
- Simple rules for quick gameplay
- Randomized die rolls for each turn

### Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or copy the game code.

### Game Instructions
1. Run the game script using Python.
2. Enter the number of players (2 - 4) when prompted.
3. Each player takes turns rolling the die:
   - Rolling a number between 2 and 6 adds that number to their score.
   - Rolling a "1" resets their score to 0 and ends their turn.
4. Players can choose to continue rolling or stop after each roll to lock in their current score.
5. The first player to reach or exceed a score of 50 wins the game!
